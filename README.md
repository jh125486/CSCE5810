### About Running/Compiling on Different Operating Systems
* Linux: DineroMultiTool was developed within a Linux enviroment with the intention of it being ran and or compiled within a Linux enviroment. Therefore, there should be no problem running and or compiling assuming the Compilation Requirements (listed down below) are met.

* Windows: There is no support for the ncurses library on Windows so you will need to enable/use the terminal that comes with the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" in order to run and or compile DineroMultiTool.

* OSX: You will need the 32-bit Ncurses library (lib32-ncurses) installed via a package manager such as MacPorts or Homebrew. You will also need the most up-to-date version of GCC installed through a package manager such as Homebrew due to openMP support (Installation tutorial: https://goo.gl/J5nxD9). From here, you will need to run the makefile included to recompile into Mac compatible executable.
